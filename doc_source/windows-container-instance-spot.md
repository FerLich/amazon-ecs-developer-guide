# Using Spot Instances<a name="windows-container-instance-spot"></a>

A Spot Instance is an unused Amazon EC2 instance that is available for less than the On\-Demand price\. Because Spot Instances allow you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly\. The hourly price for a Spot Instance is called a Spot price\. The Spot price of each instance type in each Availability Zone is set by Amazon EC2, and adjusted gradually based on the long\-term supply of and demand for Spot Instances\. For more information, see [Spot Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/using-spot-instances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances*\.

You can register Spot Instances to your Amazon ECS clusters\. For more information, see [Launching an Amazon ECS Linux container instance](launch_container_instance.md)\.

## Spot Instance Draining<a name="windows-spot-instance-draining"></a>

Amazon EC2 terminates, stops, or hibernates your Spot Instance when the Spot price exceeds the maximum price for your request or capacity is no longer available\. Amazon EC2 provides a Spot Instance interruption notice, which gives the instance a two\-minute warning before it is interrupted\. If Amazon ECS Spot Instance draining is enabled on the instance, ECS receives the Spot Instance interruption notice and places the instance in `DRAINING` status\.

**Important**  
Amazon ECS monitors for the Spot Instance interruption notices that have the `terminate` and `stop` instance\-actions\. If you specified either the `hibernate` instance interruption behavior when requesting your Spot Instances or Spot Fleet, then Amazon ECS Spot Instance draining is not supported for those instances\.

When a container instance is set to `DRAINING`, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance\. Service tasks on the draining container instance that are in the `PENDING` state are stopped immediately\. If there are container instances in the cluster that are available, replacement service tasks are started on them\.

You must set the `ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING` parameter before you start the container agent\. Use the following commands to manually turn on Spot Instance draining\. Substitute *my\-cluster* with the name of your cluster\.

```
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING", "true", "Machine")

# Initialize the agent
Initialize-ECSAgent -Cluster my-cluster
```
