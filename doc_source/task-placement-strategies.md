# Amazon ECS task placement strategies<a name="task-placement-strategies"></a>

A *task placement strategy* is an algorithm for selecting instances for task placement or tasks for termination\. Task placement strategies can be specified when either running a task or creating a new service\. The task placement strategies can be updated for existing services as well\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS task placement](task-placement.md)\.

For tasks running as part of an Amazon ECS service, the default task placement strategy is `spread` using the `attribute:ecs.availability-zone`\. There isn't a default task placement constraint for tasks in services\.

## Strategy types<a name="strategy-types"></a>

Amazon ECS supports the following task placement strategies:

`binpack`  
Tasks are placed on container instances so as to leave the least amount of unused CPU or memory\. This strategy minimizes the number of container instances in use\.  
When this strategy is used and a scale\-in action is taken, Amazon ECS terminates tasks\. It does this based on the amount of resources that are left on the container instance after the task is terminated\. The container instance that has the most available resources left after task termination has that task terminated\.

`random`  
Tasks are placed randomly\.

`spread`  
Tasks are placed evenly based on the specified value\. Accepted values are `instanceId` \(or `host`, which has the same effect\), or any platform or custom attribute that's applied to a container instance, such as `attribute:ecs.availability-zone`\.  
Service tasks are spread based on the tasks from that service\. Standalone tasks are spread based on the tasks from the same task group\. For more information about task groups, see [Task groups](task-groups.md)\.  
When the `spread` strategy is used and a scale\-in action is taken, Amazon ECS selects tasks to terminate that maintain a balance across Availability Zones\. Within an Availability Zone, tasks are selected at random\.

## Example strategies<a name="strategy-examples"></a>

You can specify task placement strategies with the following actions: [CreateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html), [UpdateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateService.html), and [RunTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html)\.

The following strategy distributes tasks evenly across Availability Zones\.

```
"placementStrategy": [
    {
        "field": "attribute:ecs.availability-zone",
        "type": "spread"
    }
]
```

The following strategy distributes tasks evenly across all instances\.

```
"placementStrategy": [
    {
        "field": "instanceId",
        "type": "spread"
    }
]
```

The following strategy bin packs tasks based on memory\.

```
"placementStrategy": [
    {
        "field": "memory",
        "type": "binpack"
    }
]
```

The following strategy places tasks randomly\.

```
"placementStrategy": [
    {
        "type": "random"
    }
]
```

The following strategy distributes tasks evenly across Availability Zones and then distributes tasks evenly across the instances within each Availability Zone\.

```
"placementStrategy": [
    {
        "field": "attribute:ecs.availability-zone",
        "type": "spread"
    },
    {
        "field": "instanceId",
        "type": "spread"
    }
]
```

The following strategy distributes tasks evenly across Availability Zones and then bin packs tasks based on memory within each Availability Zone\.

```
"placementStrategy": [
    {
        "field": "attribute:ecs.availability-zone",
        "type": "spread"
    },
    {
        "field": "memory",
        "type": "binpack"
    }
]
```
