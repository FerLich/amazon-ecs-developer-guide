# Getting started with the console using Amazon EC2<a name="getting-started-ecs-ec2-v2"></a>

Amazon Elastic Container Service \(Amazon ECS\) is a fast and highly scalable container management service that makes it easy to launch and manage your containers\. For a broad overview on Amazon ECS, see [What is Amazon Elastic Container Service?](Welcome.md)\.

Get started with Amazon ECS using the EC2 launch type by registering a task definition, creating a cluster, and creating a service in the classic console\.

Complete the following steps to get started with Amazon ECS using the EC2 launch type\.

## Prerequisites<a name="getting-started-ec2-prereqs"></a>

Before you begin, be sure that you've completed the steps in [Set up to use Amazon ECS](get-set-up-for-amazon-ecs.md) and that your AWS user has either the permissions specified in the `AdministratorAccess` or the [Amazon ECS first\-run wizard permissions](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#first-run-permissions) IAM policy example\.

## Step 1: Create a cluster<a name="getting-started-ec2-cluster-v2"></a>

An Amazon ECS cluster is a logical grouping of tasks, services, and container instances\. 

The following steps walk you through creating a cluster with one Amazon EC2 instance registered to it which will enable us to run a task on it\. If a specific field is not mentioned, leave the default console values\.

**To create a new cluster \(Amazon ECS console\)**

Before you begin, assign the appropriate IAM permission\. For more information, see [Cluster examples](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#IAM_cluster_policies)\.

1. Open the console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ecs/v2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2)\.

1. From the navigation bar, select the Region to use\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters**\.

1. On the **Clusters** page, choose **Create cluster**\.

1. Under **Cluster configuration**, for **Cluster name**, enter a unique name\.

   The name can contain up to 255 letters \(uppercase and lowercase\), numbers, and hyphens\.

1. \(Optional\) To change the VPC and subnets where your tasks and services launch, under **Networking**, perform any of the following operations:
   + To remove a subnet, under **Subnets**, choose **X** for each subnet that you want to remove\.
   + To change to a VPC other than the **default** VPC, under **VPC**, choose an existing **VPC**, and then under **Subnets**, select each subnet\.

1. \(Optional\) To add Amazon EC2 instances to your cluster, expand **Infrastructure**, and then select **Amazon EC2 instances**\. Next, configure the Auto Scaling group which acts as the capacity provider:

   1. To using an existing Auto Scaling group, from **Auto Scaling group \(ASG\)**, select the group\.

   1. To create a Auto Scaling group, from **Auto Scaling group \(ASG\)**, select **Create new group**, and then provide the following details about the group:
      + For **Operating system/Architecture**, choose the Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI for the Auto Scaling group instances\.
      + For **EC2 instance type**, choose the instance type for your workloads\.

         Managed scaling works best if your Auto Scaling group uses the same or similar instance types\. 
      + For **SSH key pair**, choose the pair that proves your identity when you connect to the instance\.
      + For **Capacity**, enter the minimum number and the maximum number of instances to launch in the Auto Scaling group\. 

1. \(Optional\) To turn on Container Insights, expand **Monitoring**, and then turn on **Use Container Insights**\.

1. \(Optional\) To manage the cluster tags, expand **Tags**, and then perform one of the following operations:

   \[Add a tag\] Choose **Add tag** and do the following:
   + For **Key**, enter the key name\.
   + For **Value**, enter the key value\.

   \[Remove a tag\] Choose **Remove** to the right of the tagâ€™s Key and Value\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

## Step 2: Register a task definition<a name="getting-started-ec2-task-def-v2"></a>

Before you can run Windows containers in your Amazon ECS cluster, you must register a task definition\. The following task definition example displays a simple webpage on port 8080 of a container instance with the `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis` container image\.

**To register the sample task definition with the AWS Management Console**

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Task Definitions**\.

1. Choose **Create new task definition**, **Create new task definition with JSON**\.

1. Copy and paste the following example task definition into the box and then choose **Save**\.

   ```
   {
       "containerDefinitions": [
           {
               "command": [
                   "New-Item -Path C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\index.html -Type file -Value '<html> <head> <title>Amazon ECS Sample App</title> <style>body {margin-top: 40px; background-color: #333;} </style> </head><body> <div style=color:white;text-align:center> <h1>Amazon ECS Sample App</h1> <h2>Congratulations!</h2> <p>Your application is now running on a container in Amazon ECS.</p>'; C:\\ServiceMonitor.exe w3svc"
               ],
               "entryPoint": [
                   "powershell",
                   "-Command"
               ],
               "essential": true,
               "cpu": 2048,
               "memory": 4096,      
               "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore-ltsc2019",
               "logConfiguration": {
                   "logDriver": "awslogs",
                   "options": {
                       "awslogs-group": "/ecs/fargate-windows-task-definition",
                       "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
                       "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs"
                   }
               },
               "name": "sample_windows_app",
               "portMappings": [
                   {
                       "hostPort": 80,
                       "containerPort": 80,
                       "protocol": "tcp"
                   }
               ]
           }
       ],
       "memory": "4096",
       "cpu": "2048",
       "networkMode": "awsvpc",
       "family": "windows-simple-iis-2019-core",
       "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::012345678910:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole",
       "runtimePlatform": {
           "operatingSystemFamily": "WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CORE"
       },
       "requiresCompatibilities": [
           "FARGATE"
       ]
   }
   ```

1. Verify your information and choose **Create**\.

## Step 3: Create a Service<a name="getting-started-ec2-service-v2"></a>

An Amazon ECS service helps you to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition simultaneously in an Amazon ECS cluster\. If any of your tasks should fail or stop for any reason, the Amazon ECS service scheduler launches another instance of your task definition to replace it in order to maintain the desired number of tasks in the service\. For more information on services, see [Amazon ECS services](ecs_services.md)\.

**To create a service**

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters**\.

1. Select the cluster you created in [Step 1: Create a cluster](#getting-started-ec2-cluster-v2)\.

1. On the **Services** tab, choose **Create**\.

1. In the **Environment** section, do the following:

   1. For **Compute options**, choose Launch type\.

   1. For **Launch type**, select **EC2**

1. In the **Deployment configuration** section, do the following:

   1. For **Family**, choose the task definition you created in [Step 1: Register a task definition](getting-started-ecs-ec2.md#getting-started-ec2-task-def)\.

   1. For **Service name**, enter a name for your service\.

   1. For **Desired tasks**, enter **1**\.

1. Review the options and choose **Create**\.

1. Choose **View service** to review your service\.

## Step 4: View your Service<a name="getting-started-ec2-view-v2"></a>

The service is a web\-based application so you can view its containers with a web browser\.

1. On the **Service: *service\-name*** page, choose the **Tasks** tab\.

1. In the **Services** tab, choose the service you created in [Step 3: Create the service](getting-started-fargate.md#create-windows-service)\.

1. On the **Service: *service\-name*** page, choose the task ID for the task in your service\.

1. In the **Configuration** section, under **Public IP**, choose **open address**\.

1. On the **Task** page, in the **Configuration** section, under **Public IP**, choose **open address**\.

## Step 5: Clean Up<a name="getting-started-ec2-cleanup-v2"></a>

When you are finished using an Amazon ECS cluster, you can clean up the resources associated with it to avoid incurring charges for resources that you are not using\.

The Amazon ECS resources created in this getting started guide, such as the cluster and service can be cleaned up using the Amazon ECS console\.

When you are finished using an Amazon ECS cluster, you should clean up the resources associated with it to avoid incurring charges for resources that you are not using\.

Some Amazon ECS resources, such as tasks, services, clusters, and container instances, are cleaned up using the Amazon ECS console\. Other resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, and Auto Scaling groups, must be cleaned up manually in the Amazon EC2 console or by deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack that created them\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters**\.

1. On the **Clusters** page, select the cluster to delete\.

1. Choose **Delete Cluster**\. At the confirmation prompt, enter **delete *cluster\-name***, and then choose **Delete**\. Deleting the cluster cleans up the associated resources that were created with the cluster, including Auto Scaling groups, VPCs, or load balancers\.
