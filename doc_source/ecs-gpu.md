# Working with GPUs on Amazon ECS<a name="ecs-gpu"></a>

Amazon ECS supports workloads that use GPUs, when you create clusters with container instances that support GPUs\. Amazon EC2 GPU\-based container instances that use the p2, p3, g3, g4, and g5 instance types provide access to NVIDIA GPUs\. For more information, see [Linux Accelerated Computing Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/accelerated-computing-instances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

Amazon ECS provides a GPU\-optimized AMI that comes with pre\-configured NVIDIA kernel drivers and a Docker GPU runtime\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI](ecs-optimized_AMI.md)\.

You can designate a number of GPUs in your task definition for task placement consideration at a container level\. Amazon ECS schedules to available container instances that support GPUs and pin physical GPUs to proper containers for optimal performance\. 

The following Amazon EC2 GPU\-based instance types are supported\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 P2 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/), [Amazon EC2 P3 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p3/), [Amazon EC2 P4d Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/), [Amazon EC2 G3 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g3/), [Amazon EC2 G4 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/), and [Amazon EC2 G5 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/)\.

## Considerations<a name="gpu-considerations"></a>

We recommend that you consider the following before you begin working with GPUs on Amazon ECS\.
+ Your clusters can contain a mix of GPU and non\-GPU container instances\.
+ You can run GPU workloads on external instances\. When registering an external instance with your cluster, ensure the `--enable-gpu` flag is included on the installation script\. For more information, see [Registering an external instance to a cluster ](ecs-anywhere-registration.md)\.
+ You must set `ECS_ENABLE_GPU_SUPPORT` to `true` in your agent configuration file\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS container agent configuration](ecs-agent-config.md)\.
+ When running a task or creating a service, you can use instance type attributes when you configure task placement constraints to determine the container instances the task is to be launched on\. By doing this, you can more effectively use your resources\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS task placement](task-placement.md)\.

  The following example launches a task on a `p2.xlarge` container instance in your default cluster\.

  ```
  aws ecs run-task --cluster default --task-definition ecs-gpu-task-def \
       --placement-constraints type=memberOf,expression="attribute:ecs.instance-type == p2.xlarge" --region us-east-2
  ```
+ For each container that has a GPU resource requirement that's specified in the container definition, Amazon ECS sets the container runtime to be the NVIDIA container runtime\.
+ The NVIDIA container runtime requires some environment variables to be set in the container to function properly\. For a list of these environment variables, see [nvidia\-container\-runtime](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime)\. Amazon ECS sets the `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable value to be a list of the GPU device IDs that Amazon ECS assigns to the container\. For the other required environment variables, Amazon ECS doesn't set them\. So, make sure that your container image sets them or they're set in the container definition\.
+ The g4 instance type family is supported on version `20190913` and later of the Amazon ECS GPU\-optimized AMI\. For more information, see [Linux Amazon ECS\-optimized AMIs versions](ecs-ami-versions.md#ecs-ami-versions-linux)\. It's not supported in the Create Cluster workflow in the Amazon ECS console\. To use these instance types, you must either use the Amazon EC2 console, AWS CLI, or API and manually register the instances to your cluster\.
+ The p4d\.24xlarge instance type only works with CUDA 11 or later\.
+ The Amazon ECS GPU\-optimized AMI has IPv6 enabled, which causes issues when using `yum`\. This can be resolved by configuring `yum` to use IPv4 with the following command\.

  ```
  echo "ip_resolve=4" >> /etc/yum.conf
  ```
+  When you build a container image that doesn't use the NVIDIA/CUDA base images, you must set the `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES` container runtime variable to one of the following values:
  + `utility,compute`
  + `all`

  For information about how to set the variable, see [Controlling the NVIDIA Container Runtime](https://sarus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/custom-cuda-images.html#controlling-the-nvidia-container-runtime) on the NVIDIA website\.
+ GPUs are not supported on Windows containers\.

## Specifying GPUs in your task definition<a name="ecs-gpu-specifying"></a>

To use the GPUs on a container instance and the Docker GPU runtime, make sure that you designate the number of GPUs your container requires in the task definition\. As containers that support GPUs are placed, the Amazon ECS container agent pins the desired number of physical GPUs to the appropriate container\. The number of GPUs reserved for all containers in a task cannot exceed the number of available GPUs on the container instance the task is launched on\. For more information, see [Creating a task definition using the new console](create-task-definition.md)\.

**Important**  
If your GPU requirements aren't specified in the task definition, the task uses the default Docker runtime\.

The following shows the JSON format for the GPU requirements in a task definition:

```
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
     {
        ...
        "resourceRequirements" : [
            {
               "type" : "GPU", 
               "value" : "2"
            }
        ],
     },
...
}
```

The following example demonstrates the syntax for a Docker container that specifies a GPU requirement\. This container uses two GPUs, runs the `nvidia-smi` utility, and then exits\.

```
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "memory": 80,
      "essential": true,
      "name": "gpu",
      "image": "nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-base",
      "resourceRequirements": [
         {
           "type":"GPU",
           "value": "2"
         }
      ],
      "command": [
        "sh",
        "-c",
        "nvidia-smi"
      ],
      "cpu": 100
    }
  ],
  "family": "example-ecs-gpu"
}
```
