# Troubleshooting ECS Anywhere issues<a name="ecs-anywhere-troubleshooting"></a>

ECS Anywhere provides support for registering an *external instance* such as a on\-premises server or virtual machine \(VM\) to your Amazon ECS cluster\. The following are common issues that you might encounter and general troubleshooting recommendations for them\.

## External instance registration issues<a name="ecs-anywhere-troubleshooting-registration"></a>

When registering an external instance with your Amazon ECS cluster, the following requirements must be met:
+ An Systems Manager activation, which consists of an *activation ID* and *activation code*, must be retrieved\. You use it to register the external instance as a Systems Manager managed instance\. When a Systems Manager activation is requested, you can specify a registration limit and expiration date\. The registration limit specifies the maximum number of instances that can be registered using the activation\. For it, the default value is `1` instance\. The expiration date specifies when the activation expires\. The default value is 24 hours\. If the Systems Manager activation that you're using to register your external instance isn't valid, request a new one\. For more information, see [Registering an external instance to a cluster](ecs-anywhere-registration.md)\.
+ An IAM policy is used to provide your external instance the permissions that it needs to communicate with AWS APIs\. If this managed policy isn't created properly and doesn't contain the required permissions, external instance registration fails\. For more information, see [Required IAM permissions for external instances](ecs-anywhere-iam.md#ecs-anywhere-iam-required)\.
+ Amazon ECS provides an installation script that installs Docker, the Amazon ECS container agent, and the Systems Manager Agent on your external instance\. If the installation script fails, it's likely that the script can't be run again on the same instance without an error occurring\. If this happens, follow the cleanup process to clear AWS resources from the instance so you can run the installation script again\. For more information, see [Deregistering an external instance](ecs-anywhere-deregistration.md)\.
**Note**  
Be aware that, if the installation script successfully requested and used the Systems Manager activation, running the installation script a second time uses the Systems Manager activation again\. This might in turn cause you to reach the registration limit for that activation\. If this limit is reached, you must create a new activation\.
+ When running the installation script on an external instance for GPU workloads, if the NVIDIA driver is not detected or configured properly an error will occur\. The installation script uses the `nvidia-smi` command to confirm the existence of the NVIDIA driver\.

## External instance network issues<a name="ecs-anywhere-troubleshooting-networking"></a>

To communicate any changes, your external instance requires a network connection to AWS\. If your external instance loses its network connection to AWS, tasks that are running on your instances continue to run anyway unless stopped manually\. After the connection to AWS is restored, the AWS credentials that are used by the Amazon ECS container agent and Systems Manager Agent on the external instance renew automatically\. For more information about the AWS domains that are used for communication between your external instance and AWS, see [Networking with ECS Anywhere](ecs-anywhere.md#ecs-anywhere-networking)\.

## Issues running tasks on your external instance<a name="ecs-anywhere-troubleshooting-runtask"></a>

If your tasks or containers fail to run on your external instance, the most common causes are either network or permission related\. If your containers are pulling their images from Amazon ECR or are configured to send container logs to CloudWatch Logs, your task definition must specify a valid task execution IAM role\. Without a valid task execution IAM role, your containers will fail to start\. For more information, see [Conditional IAM permissions](ecs-anywhere-iam.md#ecs-anywhere-iam-conditional)\. For more information about network related issues, see [External instance network issues](#ecs-anywhere-troubleshooting-networking)\.

**Important**  
Amazon ECS provides the Amazon ECS logs collection tool\. You can use it to collect logs from your external instances for troubleshooting purposes\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS logs collector](ecs-logs-collector.md)\.
