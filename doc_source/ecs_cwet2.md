# Tutorial: Sending Amazon Simple Notification Service alerts for task stopped events<a name="ecs_cwet2"></a>

In this tutorial, you configure an Amazon EventBridge event rule that only captures task events where the task has stopped running because one of its essential containers has terminated\. The event sends only task events with a specific `stoppedReason` property to the designated Amazon SNS topic\.

## Prerequisite: Set up a test cluster<a name="cwet2_step_1"></a>

 If you do not have a running cluster to capture events from, follow the steps in [Creating a cluster using the classic console](create_cluster.md) to create one\. At the end of this tutorial, you run a task on this cluster to test that you have configured your Amazon SNS topic and EventBridge rule correctly\. 

## Step 1: Create and subscribe to an Amazon SNS topic<a name="cwet2_step_2"></a>

 For this tutorial, you configure an Amazon SNS topic to serve as an event target for your new event rule\. 

For information about how to create and subscribe to an Amazon SNS topic , see [Getting started with Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-getting-started.html#step-create-queue) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide *and use the following table to determine what options to select\.


| Option | Value | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Type  | Standard | 
| Name |  TaskStoppedAlert  | 
| Protocol | Email | 
| Endpoint |  An email address to which you currently have access  | 

## Step 1a: Update Access Policy<a name="cwet2_step_2a"></a>
As described in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-use-resource-based.html#eb-sns-permissions
Following policy is required to allow EventBridge service to publish messages to your SNS topic:

{
\"Sid\": \"PublishEventsToMyTopic\",
\"Effect\": \"Allow\",
\"Principal\": {
\"Service\": \"events.amazonaws.com\"
},
\"Action\": \"sns:Publish\",
\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:sns:<region>:<account-id>:TaskStoppedAlert\"
}


## Step 2: Register an event rule<a name="cwet2_step_3"></a>

 Next, you register an event rule that captures only task\-stopped events for tasks with stopped containers\. 

For information about how to create and subscribe to an Amazon SNS topic , see [Create a rule in Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-get-started.html) in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide* and use the following table to determine what options to select\.


| Option | Value | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Rule type  |  Rule with an event pattern  | 
| Event source | AWS events or EventBridge partner events | 
| Event pattern |  Custom pattern \(JSON editor\)  | 
| Event pattern |  <pre>{<br />   "source":[<br />      "aws.ecs"<br />   ],<br />   "detail-type":[<br />      "ECS Task State Change"<br />   ],<br />   "detail":{<br />      "lastStatus":[<br />         "STOPPED"<br />      ],<br />      "stoppedReason":[<br />         "Essential container in task exited"<br />      ]<br />   }<br />}</pre> | 
| Target type |  AWS service  | 
| Target | SNS topic | 
| Topic |  TaskStoppedAlert \(The topic you created in Step 1\)  | 

## Step 3: Test your rule<a name="cwet2_step_4"></a>

Verify that the rule is working by running a task that exits shortly after it starts\. If your event rule is configured correctly, you receive an email message within a few minutes with the event text\. If you have an existing task definition that can satisfy the rule requirements, run a task using it\. If you do not, the following steps will walk you through registering a Fargate task definition and running it that will\.

**To test the rule**

1. Open the Amazon ECS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ecs/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/)\.

1. Choose **Task Definitions**, **Create new Task Definition**\.

1. For Select launch type compatibility, choose **FARGATE**, **Next step**\.

1. Choose **Configure via JSON**, copy and paste the following task definition JSON into the field and choose **Save**\.

   ```
   {
      "containerDefinitions":[
         {
            "command":[
               "sh",
               "-c",
               "sleep 5"
            ],
            "essential":true,
            "image":"amazonlinux:2",
            "name":"test-sleep"
         }
      ],
      "cpu":"256",
      "executionRoleArn":"arn:aws:iam::012345678910:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole",
      "family":"fargate-task-definition",
      "memory":"512",
      "networkMode":"awsvpc",
      "requiresCompatibilities":[
         "FARGATE"
      ]
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Create**, **View task definition**\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Run Task**\.

1. For Launch type, choose **FARGATE**\. For **VPC and security groups**, choose a VPC and Subnets for the task to use and then choose **Run Task**\.

1.  For **Container name**, type **Wordpress**, for **Image**, type **wordpress**, and for **Maximum memory \(MB\)**, type **128**\.

1. On the **Tasks** tab for your cluster, periodically choose the refresh icon until you no longer see your task running\. To verify that your task has stopped, for **Desired task status**, choose **Stopped**\.

1. Check your email to confirm that you have received an email alert for the stopped notification\.
