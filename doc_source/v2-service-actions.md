# Service management in the Amazon ECS console<a name="v2-service-actions"></a>

You can deploy, update, and delete an Amazon ECS service using the classic Amazon ECS console or the new Amazon ECS console\.

Use the following guidelines to determine which console to use:
+ If you want to use the blue/green deployment type, you must use the classic Amazon ECS console\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon ECS service in the classic console](create-service.md)\.
+ If you want to use the rolling update deployment type, use the new Amazon ECS console to take advantage of the deployment failure detection options\. For more information, see [Creating a service using the console](create-service-console-v2.md)\.
