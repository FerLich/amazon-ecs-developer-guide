# Migrating to the `AmazonECS_FullAccess` managed policy<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol-amazonecs-full-access-migration"></a>

The `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess` managed IAM policy was phased out on January 29, 2021, in response to a security finding with the `iam:passRole` permission\. This permission grants access to all resources including credentials to roles in the account\. Now that the policy is phased out, you can't attach the policy to any new groups, users, or roles\. Any groups, users, or roles that already have the policy attached can continue using it\. However, we recommend that you update your groups, users, or roles to use the `AmazonECS_FullAccess` managed policy instead\.

The permissions that are granted by the `AmazonECS_FullAccess` policy include the complete list of permissions that are necessary to use ECS as an administrator\. If you currently use permissions that are granted by the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess` policy that aren't in the `AmazonECS_FullAccess` policy, you can add them to an in\-line policy statement\. For more information, see [AWS managed policies for Amazon Elastic Container Service](security-iam-awsmanpol.md)\.

Use the following steps to determine if you have any groups, users, or roles that are currently using the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess` managed IAM policy\. Then, update them to detach the earlier policy and attach the `AmazonECS_FullAccess` policy\.

**To update a group, user, or role to use the AmazonECS\_FullAccess policy \(AWS Management Console\)**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies** and search for and select the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess` policy\.

1. Choose the **Policy usage** tab that displays any IAM role that's currently using this policy\.

1. For each IAM role that's currently using the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess` policy, select the role and use the following steps to detach the deprecated policy and attach the `AmazonECS_FullAccess` policy\.

   1. On the **Permissions** tab, choose the **X** next to the **AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess** policy\.

   1. Choose **Add permissions**\.

   1. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**, search for and select the **AmazonECS\_FullAccess** policy, and then choose **Next: Review**\.

   1. Review the changes and then choose **Add permissions**\.

   1. Repeat these steps for each group, user, or role that's using the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess` policy\.

**To update a group, user, or role to use the `AmazonECS_FullAccess` policy \(AWS CLI\)**

1. Use the [generate\-service\-last\-accessed\-details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/generate-service-last-accessed-details.html) command to generate a report that includes details about when the deprecated policy was last used\.

   ```
   aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \
        --arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   {
       "JobId": "32bb1fb0-1ee0-b08e-3626-ae83EXAMPLE"
   }
   ```

1. Use the job ID from the previous output with the [get\-service\-last\-accessed\-details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/get-service-last-accessed-details.html) command to retrieve the last accessed report of the service\. This report displays the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the IAM entities that last used the deprecated policy\.

   ```
   aws iam get-service-last-accessed-details \
         --job-id 32bb1fb0-1ee0-b08e-3626-ae83EXAMPLE
   ```

1. Use one of the following commands to detach the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess` policy from a group, user, or role\.
   + [detach\-group\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/detach-group-policy.html)
   + [detach\-role\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/detach-role-policy.html)
   + [detach\-user\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/detach-user-policy.html)

1. Use one of the following commands to attach the `AmazonECS_FullAccess` policy to a group, user, or role\.
   + [attach\-group\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/attach-group-policy.html)
   + [attach\-role\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/attach-role-policy.html)
   + [attach\-user\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/attach-user-policy.html)
