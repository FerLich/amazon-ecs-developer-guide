# Creating a service using the classic Amazon ECS console<a name="create-service-console-v1"></a>

**Important**  
Amazon ECS has provided a new console experience for creating a service\. For more information, see [Creating a service using the new console](create-service-console-v2.md)\.  
If you're creating a Windows service for the Fargate launch type, you must use the classic console\.  
If you want to use the Amazon CloudWatch alarms method to detect deployment failures, you must use the new console\. For more information, see [Creating a service using the new console](create-service-console-v2.md)\.

The Amazon ECS console provides a create service wizard that guides you through each step to create a service\. 

If you have not already done so, follow the basic service configuration procedures in [Step 1: Configuring basic service parameters](basic-service-params.md)\.
