Welcome to the new Amazon ECS console

We're in the process of rolling out the new console\.

**Work in progress**

We’re working continuously to improve the experience\. Here’s what we’re currently working on:
+ **Updating clusters**
+ **Spot Instances** \- For the EC2 launch type, using Spot Instances for your cluster Auto Scaling group

There will be many more improvements to the launch experience in the months ahead\.

**Please send feedback**  
We’d appreciate your feedback on the new launch instance wizard\. We’ll use your feedback to continue improving the experience over the next few months\. You can send us feedback directly from the Amazon ECS console, or use the **Provide feedback** link at the bottom of this page\.
