# External instances \(Amazon ECS Anywhere\)<a name="ecs-anywhere"></a>

Amazon ECS Anywhere provides support for registering an *external instance* such as an on\-premises server or virtual machine \(VM\), to your Amazon ECS cluster\. External instances are optimized for running applications that generate outbound traffic or process data\. If your application requires inbound traffic, the lack of Elastic Load Balancing support makes running these workloads less efficient\. Amazon ECS added a new `EXTERNAL` launch type that you can use to create services or run tasks on your external instances\.

The following provides a high\-level system architecture overview of Amazon ECS Anywhere\.

## Supported operating systems and system architectures<a name="ecs-anywhere-supported-os"></a>

The following is the list of supported operating systems and system architectures\.
+ Amazon Linux 2
+ CentOS 7
**Important**  
CentOS 8 has reached its End Of Life \(EOL\) on December 31, 2021 and is no longer supported by Amazon ECS Anywhere\.
+ CentOS Stream 8
+ RHEL 7, RHEL 8 — Neither Docker or RHEL's open package repositories support installing Docker natively on RHEL\. You must ensure that Docker is installed before you run the install script that's described in this document\.
+ Fedora 32, Fedora 33 — Fedora 32 and Fedora 33 default to using `cgroups.v2`, which isn't supported by Amazon ECS\. As a result, the server's default grub configuration must be changed and the server rebooted\. For instructions, see [Changing cgroup version](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/runmetrics/#changing-cgroup-version) in the Docker documentation\.
+ openSUSE Tumbleweed
+ Ubuntu 18, Ubuntu 20
+ Debian 9, Debian 10
+ SUSE Enterprise Server 15
+ The `x86_64` and `ARM64` CPU architectures are supported\.
+ The following Windows operating system versions are supported:
  + Windows Server 2022 
  + Windows Server 2019 
  + Windows Server 2016 
  + Windows Server 20H2

## Considerations<a name="ecs-anywhere-considerations"></a>

Before you start using external instances, be aware of the following considerations\.
+ You can register an external instance to one cluster at a time\. For instructions on how to register an external instance with a different cluster, see [Deregistering an external instance](ecs-anywhere-deregistration.md)\.
+ Your external instances require an IAM role that allows them to communicate with AWS APIs\. For more information, see [Required IAM permissions for external instances](ecs-anywhere-iam.md#ecs-anywhere-iam-required)\.
+ Your external instances should not have a preconfigured instance credential chain defined locally as this will interfere with the registration script\.
+ To send container logs to CloudWatch Logs, make sure that you create and specify a task execution IAM role in your task definition\. For more information, see [Conditional IAM permissions](ecs-anywhere-iam.md#ecs-anywhere-iam-conditional)\.
+ When an external instance is registered to a cluster, the `ecs.capability.external` attribute is associated with the instance\. This attribute identifies the instance as an external instance\. You can add custom attributes to your external instances to use as a task placement constraint\. For more information, see [Custom attributes](task-placement-constraints.md#ecs-custom-attributes)\.
+ You can add resource tags to your external instance\. For more information, see [Adding tags to an external container instance](ecs-using-tags.md#instance-details-tags-external)\.
+ ECS Exec is supported on external instances\. For more information, see [Using Amazon ECS Exec for debugging](ecs-exec.md)\.
+ The following are additional considerations that are specific to networking with your external instances\. For more information, see [Networking with ECS Anywhere](#ecs-anywhere-networking)\.
  + Service load balancing isn't supported\.
  + Service discovery isn't supported\.
  + Tasks that run on external instances must use the `bridge`, `host`, or `none` network modes\. The `awsvpc` network mode isn't supported\.
  + There are Amazon ECS service domains in each AWS Region\. These service domains must be allowed to send traffic to your external instances\.
  + The SSM Agent installed on your external instance maintains IAM credentials that are rotated every 30 minutes using a hardware fingerprint\. If your external instance loses connection to AWS, the SSM Agent automatically refreshes the credentials after the connection is re\-established\. For more information, see [Validating on\-premises servers and virtual machines using a hardware fingerprint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent-technical-details.html#fingerprint-validation) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.
+ The `UpdateContainerAgent` API isn't supported\. For instructions on how to update the SSM Agent or the Amazon ECS agent on your external instances, see [Updating the AWS Systems Manager Agent and Amazon ECS container agent on an external instance](ecs-anywhere-updates.md)\.
+ Amazon ECS capacity providers aren't supported\. To create a service or run a standalone task on your external instances, use the `EXTERNAL` launch type\.
+ SELinux isn't supported\.
+ Using Amazon EFS volumes or specifying an `EFSVolumeConfiguration` isn't supported\.
+ Integration with App Mesh isn't supported\.
+ When you run ECS Anywhere on Windows, you must use your own Windows license on the on\-premises infrastructure\.

### Networking with ECS Anywhere<a name="ecs-anywhere-networking"></a>

Amazon ECS external instances are optimized for running applications that generate outbound traffic or process data\. If your application requires inbound traffic, such as a web service, the lack of Elastic Load Balancing support makes running these workloads less efficient because there isn't support for placing these workloads behind a load balancer\.

The following are additional considerations that are specific to networking with your external instances\. 
+ Service load balancing isn't supported\.
+ Service discovery isn't supported\.
+ Linux tasks that run on external instances must use the `bridge`, `host`, or `none` network modes\. The `awsvpc` network mode isn't supported\. 

  For more information about each network mode, see [Choosing a network mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/bestpracticesguide/networking-networkmode.html) in the *Amazon ECS Best Practices Guide*\.
+ Windows tasks that run on external instances must use the `default` network mode\.
+ There are Amazon ECS service domains in each AWS Region\. These service domains must be allowed to send traffic to your external instances\.
+ The SSM Agent installed on your external instance maintains IAM credentials that are rotated every 30 minutes using a hardware fingerprint\. If your external instance loses connection to AWS, the SSM Agent automatically refreshes the credentials after the connection is re\-established\. For more information, see [Validating on\-premises servers and virtual machines using a hardware fingerprint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent-technical-details.html#fingerprint-validation) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.

The following domains are used for communication between the Amazon ECS service and the Amazon ECS agent that's installed on your external instance\. Make sure that traffic is allowed and that DNS resolution works\. For each endpoint, *region* represents the Region identifier for an AWS Region that's supported by Amazon ECS, such as `us-east-2` for the US East \(Ohio\) Region\. The endpoints for all Regions that you use should be allowed\. For the `ecs-a` and `ecs-t` endpoints, you should include an asterisk \(for example, `ecs-a-*`\)\.
+ `ecs-a-*.region.amazonaws.com` — This endpoint is used when managing tasks\.
+ `ecs-t-*.region.amazonaws.com` — This endpoint is used to manage task and container metrics\.
+ `ecs.region.amazonaws.com` — This is the service endpoint for Amazon ECS\.
+ `ssm.region.amazonaws.com ` — This is the service endpoint for AWS Systems Manager\.
+ `ec2messages.region.amazonaws.com` — This is the service endpoint that AWS Systems Manager uses to communicate between the Systems Manager agent and the Systems Manager service in the cloud\.
+ `ssmmessages.region.amazonaws.com` — This is the service endpoint that is required to create and delete session channels with the Session Manager service in the cloud\.
+ If your tasks require communication with any other AWS services, make sure that those service endpoints are allowed\. Example applications include using Amazon ECR to pull container images or using CloudWatch for CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [Service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

### Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with ECS Anywhere<a name="ecs-anywhere-fsx"></a>

In order to use the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with Amazon ECS external instances you must establish a connection between your on\-premises data center and the AWS Cloud\. For information about the options for connecting your network to your VPC, see [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Connectivity Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/introduction.html)\.

### gMSA with ECS Anywhere<a name="ecs-anywhere-gmsa"></a>

The following use cases are supported for ECS Anywhere\.
+ The Active Directory is in the AWS Cloud \- For this configuration, you create a connection between your on\-premises network and the AWS Cloud using an AWS Direct Connect connection\. For information about how to create the connection, see [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Connectivity Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/introduction.html)\.You create an Active Directory in the AWS Cloud\. For information about how to get started with AWS Directory Service, see [Setting up AWS Directory Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/setting_up.html) in the *AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*\. You can then join your external instances to the domain using the AWS Direct Connect connection\. For information about working with gMSA with Amazon ECS, see [Using gMSAs for Windows Containers](windows-gmsa.md)\.
+ The Active Directory is in the on\-premises data center\. \- For this configuration, you join your external instances to the on\-premises Active Directory\. You then use the locally available credentials when you run the Amazon ECS tasks\.
