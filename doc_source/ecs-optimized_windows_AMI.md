# Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI<a name="ecs-optimized_windows_AMI"></a>

The Amazon ECS\-optimized AMIs are preconfigured with the necessary components that you need to run Amazon ECS workloads\. Although you can create your own container instance AMI that meets the basic specifications needed to run your containerized workloads on Amazon ECS, the Amazon ECS\-optimized AMIs are preconfigured and tested on Amazon ECS by AWS engineers\. It is the simplest way for you to get started and to get your containers running on AWS quickly\.

The Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI metadata, including the AMI name, Amazon ECS container agent version, and Amazon ECS runtime version which includes the Docker version, for each variant can be retrieved programmatically\. For more information, see [Retrieving Amazon ECS\-Optimized AMI metadata](retrieve-ecs-optimized_windows_AMI.md)\.

## Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI variants<a name="ecs-optimized-ami-variants"></a>

The following Windows Server variants of the Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI are available for your Amazon EC2 instances\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Windows containers](ECS_Windows.md)\.

**Important**  
All ECS\-optimized AMI variants produced after August will be migrating from Docker EE \(Mirantis\) to Docker CE \(Moby project\)\.
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2022 Full AMI** 
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2022 Core AMI** 
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2019 Full AMI** 
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2019 Core AMI** 
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2016 Full AMI**
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2004 Core AMI**
**Important**  
On December 14, 2021, the Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2004 Core AMI reached its end of support date\. No new versions of this AMI will be released\. For more information, see [Windows Server release information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/windows-server-release-info)\.
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 20H2 Core AMI**
**Important**  
On August 9, 2022, the Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 20H2 Core AMI reached its end of support date\. No new versions of this AMI will be released\. For more information, see [Windows Server release information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/windows-server-release-info)\.

 Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2016 are Long\-Term Servicing Channel \(LTSC\) releases\. Windows Server 20H2 is a Semi\-Annual Channel \(SAC\) release\. For more information, see [Windows Server release information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/windows-server-release-info)\.

## <a name="ecs-optimized-ami-windows"></a>

The following are the details for retrieving the AMI IDs for each of the Windows variants of the Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI\. You can subscribe to the Windows AMI Amazon SNS topics to be notified when a new AMI is released or an AMI version is marked private\. For more information, see [Subscribing to Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI update notifications](ECS-AMI-windows-SubscribeTopic.md)\.

**Important**  
 All ECS\-optimized AMI variants produced after August will be migrating from Docker EE \(Mirantis\) to Docker CE \(Moby project\)\.  
To ensure that customers have the latest security updates by default, Amazon ECS maintains at least the last three Windows Amazon ECS\-optimized AMIs\. After releasing new Windows Amazon ECS\-optimized AMIs, Amazon ECS makes the Windows Amazon ECS\-optimized AMIs that are older private\. If there is a private AMI that you need access to, let us know by filing a ticket with Cloud Support\.

### Windows Server 2022 Full<a name="windows-2022-full-ami"></a>

The current Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2022 Full AMI can be retrieved using the AWS CLI with the following command:

```
aws ssm get-parameters --names /aws/service/ami-windows-latest/Windows_Server-2022-English-Full-ECS_Optimized
```
